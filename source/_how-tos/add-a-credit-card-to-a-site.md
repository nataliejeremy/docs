There may be certain contexts when it easier to attach a card to a specific site instead of to the global account first. As a result we offer you more than one way to get setup on Pantheon.

### Select your site

Start by choosing the site you would like to add a card to from the list of available sites on your Pantheon user account dashboard.

### Select the "Billing" tab under site "Settings"

After you get to your site's dashboard, you can click the “_Settings_” button in the upper-right corner of your site's workspace. A modal window will pop up. Select "Billing"

### Add the billing information

If there is no card currently associated with the site you will land on the "Plan" tab which is the default whenever you load your site's settings. Initially you will be presented with a message that will let you know that to select a plan, first you must add a billing method.

To add a card, either click on the billing tab within the modal or click the message to and you will be presented with the a form where you can enter your desired payment method.

Once you have successfully entered in the payment information, you will be redirected to the "Plan" tab where you can proceed to select your site's plan. For more information about pricing and what you get, check out the pricing page.

### Confirming the card was added

Once that process is complete a confirmation box will appear to let you know that the card has been added successfully. If you get any validation errors, just make sure that everything on the billing form is correct and try again.

With a plan selected you can now access additional features like add a custom domain name to your site, or if you are a Pro account or higher, add SSL and more.

### Accessing Premium features

Developing your site and enjoying the advanced features like Workflow, Team management and New Relic can all be accessed for FREE, however there are also premium features that require you to have a payment method associated with your site.

For example, when adding SSL you will see a prompt that will let you know that you need to update your site's plan:

At this point simply clicking the highlighted message above will load the "Settings" modal, where you can either select your plan, or proceed to "Billing" where you can enter your billing information.
